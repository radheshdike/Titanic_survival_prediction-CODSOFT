# Titanic_survival_prediction-CODSOFT
#step 1: Understand the problem statement
  Predicting whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not.
  Identify the target variable: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
  Determine evaluation metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score depending on the project requirements.

  
#step 2: Gather Data
  Collect the Titanic dataset containing information about passengers such as name, age, gender, class, etc. This dataset is widely available in kaggle.

  
#step 3: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
  Handle missing values: Fill missing values in features like age, cabin, and embarked by using pandas like mean,mode,drop,dropna,dataframe
  Data Visualization: To make the dataset in easily understandable way like histogram, piechart, barchart, lineplot etc..
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  Analyze the distribution of features and target variable.
                                    Explore relationships between features and the target variable using visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices.
                                    Identify patterns and insights that might help in feature selection or engineering.

                                    
#step 4: Model Selection and Training:
  Split the data into training and testing sets.
  Select appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification tasks like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), etc. If i choose Logistic Regression.
  Train multiple models on the training data and evaluate their performance using cross-validation techniques.
  Tune hyperparameters of selected models using techniques like grid search or random search to optimize performance.

  
#step 5: Model Evaluation:
  Evaluate models on the testing dataset using evaluation metrics defined earlier.
  Compare the performance of different models and choose the best-performing one.
  To find the accuracy of both training and testing data

  
#step 6:
  This is an final step, to check the particular passage is survived or not in the kaggle dataset
